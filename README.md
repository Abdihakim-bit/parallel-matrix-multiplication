# Parallel Matrix Multiplication (C++)

This repository contains an implementation of matrix multiplication using **parallel programming** techniques in C++.

## Overview

This project implements parallel matrix multiplication using C++ threads. The goal is to improve performance over a sequential approach by dividing the task across multiple threads.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abdihakim-bit/parallel-matrix-multiplication.git 
    ```

2. Build the C++ code:
    - Open the project in **Visual Studio** or use a **C++ compiler**.

3. Run the parallel matrix multiplication:
    - In **Visual Studio**, simply use the **Local Windows Debugger** to run it.
      
    - To run from terminal, ensure you have `g++` installed, then run:
      
    ```bash
    g++ parallel_multiplication.cpp -o parallel_multiplication
    ./parallel_multiplication
    ```
